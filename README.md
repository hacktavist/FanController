Sc00bz created a tool for demodulating on/off keying and you can find it [here](https://github.com/Sc00bz/DemodulateOOK) (I found it after manually reading about 3 of the wav files I had; I think there were 5 in total for this project)

There are many tutorials for RF and OOK. Google is your friend here: Michael Ossmann and HAK5 both have great write-ups/videos for this or you can find even more
